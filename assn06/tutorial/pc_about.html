          <h2>Our Company</h2>
          <img src="pc_photo6.png" alt="" />
          <p>We are a company located in Essex, Vermont, dedicated to making delicious chocolate and other treats. For our founder, 
             chocolatier Anne Ambrose, this means using only the finest 
             organic ingredients, incorporating a harmonious blend of rich 
             flavors and smooth textures.</p>
          <p>Anne learned her trade as part of a three-year apprenticeship 
             program in Switzerland. Her introduction into the world of 
             confectioneries was a springboard to working with leaders in
             the field. Early in 1993 she brought that expertise back to 
             Vermont and Pandaisia Chocolates was born.</p>

            <h3>Enjoying Chocolates</h3>
            <p>We believe that the best chocolate is fresh chocolate. 
                   Preservatives change the flavor and texture of chocolate. 
                   For the best results, our chocolates should be consumed 
                   within a few days of purchase. Store them in a
                   cool, dark place at a temperature of 60&deg; to 
                   70&deg; such as a refrigerator or wine cellar.</p>

            <h3>Healthy Chocolate</h3>
            <p>Chocolate has a bad reputation because of the poor 
                   quality of mass-produced bars loaded with lots of milk, 
                   sugar, and butter &mdash; which are tasty but not 
                   healthy. We start with organic ingredients, keep the 
                   processed sugars to a minimum and produce dark chocolate 
                   that is 73% cacao. At that level, you can reap the benefits 
                   of a chocolate diet!</p>
